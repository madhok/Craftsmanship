CopyConstructor:
A copy constructor is a special constructor for a class/struct that is
used to make a copy of an existing instance.

Assignment operator:
The assignment operator for a class is what allows you to use
= to assign one instance to another

Virtual functions:
	Virtuals functions are those functions whose behavious is overridden within an inheriting class by a function with same signature.

Polymorphism
 Polymorphism means that some code or operations or objects behave differently in different contexts.


Process and threads
	A process is an executing instance of an application. 

	A thread is a path of execution within a process. smallest unit of execution

	Threads can be dependent on each other as they share the same memory space. Process are usually independent of each other.

Difference  - shared memory space.

Deadlock:
	A deadlock is a situation in which two or more competing actions are each waiting for the other to finish, and thus neither ever does.

Race Condition:
Its a condition where the output of the system depends on sequence/ timing of the input.
Example:  bank account - shared account - 2 people withdraw the money at the same time.

Const

Read it backwards...

int* - pointer to int
int const * - pointer to const int
int * const - const pointer to int
int const * const - const pointer to const int
Now the first const can be on either side of the type so:

const int * == int const *
const int * const == int const * const
